# Ontologies

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Below are the ontologies used in the data stores. They are grouped by their purpose, thinking grammatically, and fit
into one of the following categories:

- Objects (subject, direct object, indirect object)
- Attributes (adjectives, adverbs, perspectives and representations)
- Relations (verbs, prepositions)


## Objects (Tables: Primary)

- Glyphs: Single hieroglyph characters
    - `gardiner_code`
- Terms: An Egyptian word in hieroglyphs
- Translations: Into language of choice, from Egyptian hieroglyphs. Will start with English, but will also have (empty)
  tables for German and French to be populated later. (Contributors welcome!)


## Attributes (Columns; Tables: Secondary)
